	* /trunk/httpdocs/Controllers, /trunk/httpdocs/index.php,
	  /trunk/httpdocs/public: Renamed Controllers to public

2009-01-11 05:11  vmc

	* /trunk/Artisan/Db/Sql/Select.php: Fixed #33 by adding the code to
	  clear the group_field_list and set the order_field and
	  order_method to NULL at the end of build()

2009-01-11 05:23  vmc

	* /trunk/Artisan/User/Db.php: Made protected so classes derived
	  from here can use it

2009-01-11 15:16  vmc

	* /trunk/Artisan/Customer.php,
	  /trunk/Artisan/Customer/Adapter/Db.php,
	  /trunk/Artisan/Db/Sql.php, /trunk/Artisan/Db/Sql/Select.php,
	  /trunk/Artisan/User.php: Commented out the building of the sql
	  during the echo to prevent reset queries being executed. Perhaps
	  a flag for when queries are built is set, and then when executed,
	  unset so that way building only has to happen once.

2009-01-11 16:06  vmc

	* /trunk/Artisan/Vo.php: Updated exists() to use property_exists
	  rather than isset() so that way NULL values show up as true.

2009-01-11 17:47  vmc

	* /trunk/Artisan/Customer.php: Added the different revision
	  constants types (A, M, D) and the head as 'head' and added the
	  member variables for keeping track of revision data (#35)

2009-01-11 17:48  vmc

	* /trunk/Artisan/Customer/Adapter/Db.php: Major updates to the
	  _load() method in that it now can load up the revision data of
	  any customer from any point in time. Gotta admit, this is pretty
	  slick (#35)

2009-01-11 22:47  vmc

	* /trunk/Artisan/Db/Sql.php: Removed the commented ->build() in
	  __toString()

2009-01-12 03:49  vmc

	* /trunk/Artisan/Db/Sql/Select.php: Updated the build() method to
	  clear out the join_table_list after building the query so it's
	  not reused. (#33)

2009-01-12 03:58  vmc

	* /trunk/Artisan/Customer.php,
	  /trunk/Artisan/Customer/Adapter/Db.php: Just going to check these
	  in althought they're not complete because I'm going to totally
	  restructure the Customer class and want at least one snapshot
	  before I do

2009-01-12 04:10  vmc

	* /trunk/Artisan/Customer.php,
	  /trunk/Artisan/Customer/Adapter/Db.php: Updated the classes to
	  not extend from User so that'll stay totally separate, gonna go
	  with constructor based load rather than configuration, maybe

2009-01-12 11:21  vmc

	* /trunk/Artisan/Customer.php: Rearranged a few things, added new
	  fields _customer, _customerField, and _customerOriginal

2009-01-12 11:22  vmc

	* /trunk/Artisan/Customer/Adapter/Db.php: Rearranged the how the
	  constructor works and how the _load() works

2009-01-12 11:25  vmc

	* /trunk/Artisan/Customer/Adapter/Db.php: Was able to remove all of
	  the code to find the current revision since that's done when
	  finding if a revision should be loaded

2009-01-12 11:33  vmc

	* /trunk/Artisan/Db/Sql/Select.php: Added the limit() method so
	  that a limited number of fields can be returned.

2009-01-12 11:33  vmc

	* /trunk/Artisan/Customer/Adapter/Db.php: Nevermind, had to add the
	  query to get the latest revision in there.

2009-01-12 12:09  vmc

	* /trunk/Artisan/Customer.php: Finished the __set() magic method to
	  set a value in the or members

2009-01-12 12:10  vmc

	* /trunk/Artisan/Customer/Adapter/Db.php: Added the _update() code
	  back in

2009-01-13 03:21  vmc

	* /trunk/Artisan/Customer/Adapter/Db.php: Removed the old variable
	  in exchange for all of the individual tables (#35)

2009-01-13 03:34  vmc

	* /trunk/Artisan/Customer.php: Updated the * variables to be *, and
	  slightly more abbreviated (#10)

2009-01-13 04:24  vmc

	* /trunk/Artisan/Vo.php: Added the length() method to quickly
	  return the length of a value object

2009-01-13 04:24  vmc

	* /trunk/Artisan/Saveable.php: Base class for saveable objects, one
	  of the new features of Artisan System

2009-01-13 04:25  vmc

	* /trunk/Artisan/Customer/Group.php: Added the Group.php which will
	  soon have the class Artisan_Customer_Group for managing what
	  group(s) a customer is in.

2009-01-13 04:25  vmc

	* /trunk/Artisan/Customer.php: Updated __set() to not allow direct
	  manipulation of the customer_id of the value object (the value
	  object isn't used anyway, but its best to prevent this)

2009-01-13 04:26  vmc

	* /trunk/Artisan/Customer/Adapter/Db.php: Updated the _load()
	  method to work a bit more efficiently and sanely, now loads up
	  the revisions additional fields at the same time as the default
	  fields

2009-01-13 04:28  vmc

	* /tags/0.3a1: Creating 0.3a1 from the trunk, will work in here
	  until the 0.3 release.

	  /tags/v0.3a1/Install_Sql/tag0.3a1.020.alter_table_customer_history_add_customer_id.sql,
	  /tags/v0.3a1/Install_Sql/tag0.3a1.021.alter_table_customer_history_add_type.sql:
	  Adding the new customer database files in the 0.3a1 tag

2009-01-13 10:52  vmc

	* /tags/v0.3a1/Artisan/Customer.php: Commented out and made a
	  regular array, now will just store the additional fields for
	  writing later.

2009-01-13 10:52  vmc

	* /tags/v0.3a1/Artisan/Customer/Adapter/Db.php: Starting to update
	  _load() to load all of the data (default and additional) and only
	  put additional fields in the list

2009-01-13 11:31  vmc

	* /tags/v0.3a1/Artisan/Customer/Adapter/Db.php: Got the updating of
	  the additional fields working

2009-01-13 11:58  vmc

	  New queries to rebuild the database

2009-01-14 04:08  vmc

	* /tags/v0.3a1/Artisan/Customer/Adapter/Db.php: Sweet, got the
	  versioned code working pretty nicely now. Works more like a real
	  revision control where it loads up the head if no revision is
	  specified, otherwise, the most current revision.

2009-01-14 13:13  vmc

	* /tags/v0.3a1/Artisan/Vo.php: Added __unset() to remove elements

2009-01-15 11:43  vmc

	  use LAST_INSERT_ID() because sometimes ->CONN->insertId doesn't
	  work well

2009-01-15 11:46  vmc

	* /tags/v0.3a1/Artisan/Db/Adapter/Mysqli.php: Updated insertId() to
	  use mysqli_insert_id() by passing the connection object to it as
	  ->CONN->insert_id doesn't work well.

2009-01-15 11:46  vmc

	* /tags/v0.3a1/Artisan/Customer.php,
	  /tags/v0.3a1/Artisan/Customer/Adapter/Db.php: Totally changed the

	* /tags/v0.3a1/Artisan/Cache/Adapter/Apc.php: Updated fetch() to

	* /tags/v0.3a1/Artisan/Cache/Adapter.php: Added the method
	  started() which returns true if the cache has started, and false

	  server goes down or can not be connected to.

2009-01-22 11:16  vmc

	* /tags/v0.3a1/Artisan/Session.php: Updated the start() method to

	  /tags/v0.3a1/Artisan/Controller/View.php: The __execute() method

	  request). However, if a layout file is specified, it is used (#7)

2009-01-24 02:47  vmc

	* /tags/v0.3a1/Artisan/Cache/Adapter.php: Required the exception

2009-01-24 13:29  vmc

	* /tags/v0.3a1/Artisan/User.php: Made the Artisan_User class non
	  abstract and all of the abstract methods return true. That way it
	  removes the Artisan_User_Default class so creating a user with
	  basic information is just doing new Artisan_User() (#29)

2009-01-24 14:19  vmc

	* /tags/v0.3a1/Artisan/Auth/Db.php: Major refactoring and updates
	  to the authenticate() method. Now checks the password salt. Also,

2009-01-25 04:21  vmc

	* /tags/v0.3a1/Artisan/Versionable.php: And renamed the class to
	  have the same name as the file for the versionable objects.

2009-01-25 04:27  vmc

	* /tags/v0.3a1/Artisan/Customer/Group.php: Basic customer group

2009-01-25 13:44  vmc

	* /tags/v0.3a1/Artisan/Db/Result/Aggregate.php: The base

	  The methods in here are the only ones to defy the Artisan_System
	  coding standards.

2009-01-25 16:00  vmc

	* /tags/v0.3a1/Artisan/Db.php: Now requires the iterator class,
	  perhaps this should be required when necessary.

2009-01-26 11:53  vmc

	  directly modified. (#11)

2009-01-26 11:54  vmc

	* /tags/v0.3a1/Artisan/Db/Iterator.php: The variable passed to the
	  construct can either be a new object or a string. If its already
	  an object, it doesn't require building the object in each
	  current() method which helps on objects that have a large
	  construction time.

2009-01-26 11:58  vmc

	* /tags/v0.3a1/Artisan/Db/Iterator.php: Updated current() to not
	  call another ->row() after the data is fetched, why is this like
	  this?

2009-01-26 12:00  vmc

	* /tags/v0.3a1/Artisan/Customer/Adapter/Db.php: Reformatted the
