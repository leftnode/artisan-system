2009-03-03 12:31  vmc

2009-03-03 12:30  vmc

2009-01-13 04:26  vmc

	* Artisan/Customer/Adapter/Db.php: Updated the _load() method to
	  work a bit more efficiently and sanely, now loads up the
	  revisions additional fields at the same time as the default
	  fields

2009-01-13 04:25  vmc

	* Artisan/Customer.php: Updated __set() to not allow direct
	  manipulation of the customer_id of the value object (the value
	  object isn't used anyway, but its best to prevent this)

2009-01-13 04:25  vmc

	* Artisan/Customer/Group.php: Added the Group.php which will soon
	  have the class Artisan_Customer_Group for managing what group(s)
	  a customer is in.

2009-01-13 04:24  vmc

	* Artisan/Saveable.php: Base class for saveable objects, one of the
	  new features of Artisan System

2009-01-13 04:24  vmc

	* Artisan/Vo.php: Added the length() method to quickly return the
	  length of a value object

2009-01-13 03:34  vmc

	* Artisan/Customer.php: Updated the * variables to be *, and
	  slightly more abbreviated (#10)

2009-01-13 03:21  vmc

	* Artisan/Customer/Adapter/Db.php: Removed the old variable in
	  exchange for all of the individual tables (#35)

2009-01-12 12:10  vmc

	* Artisan/Customer/Adapter/Db.php: Added the _update() code back in

2009-01-12 12:09  vmc

	* Artisan/Customer.php: Finished the __set() magic method to set a
	  value in the or members

2009-01-12 11:33  vmc

	* Artisan/Customer/Adapter/Db.php: Nevermind, had to add the query
	  to get the latest revision in there.

2009-01-12 11:33  vmc

	* Artisan/Db/Sql/Select.php: Added the limit() method so that a
	  limited number of fields can be returned.

2009-01-12 11:25  vmc

	* Artisan/Customer/Adapter/Db.php: Was able to remove all of the
	  code to find the current revision since that's done when finding
	  if a revision should be loaded

2009-01-12 11:22  vmc

	* Artisan/Customer/Adapter/Db.php: Rearranged the how the
	  constructor works and how the _load() works

2009-01-12 11:21  vmc

	* Artisan/Customer.php: Rearranged a few things, added new fields
	  _customer, _customerField, and _customerOriginal

2009-01-12 04:10  vmc

	* Artisan/Customer.php, Artisan/Customer/Adapter/Db.php: Updated
	  the classes to not extend from User so that'll stay totally
	  separate, gonna go with constructor based load rather than
	  configuration, maybe

2009-01-12 03:58  vmc

	* Artisan/Customer.php, Artisan/Customer/Adapter/Db.php: Just going
	  to check these in althought they're not complete because I'm
	  going to totally restructure the Customer class and want at least
	  one snapshot before I do

2009-01-12 03:49  vmc

	* Artisan/Db/Sql/Select.php: Updated the build() method to clear
	  out the join_table_list after building the query so it's not
	  reused. (#33)

2009-01-11 22:47  vmc

	* Artisan/Db/Sql.php: Removed the commented ->build() in
	  __toString()

2009-01-11 17:48  vmc

	* Artisan/Customer/Adapter/Db.php: Major updates to the _load()
	  method in that it now can load up the revision data of any
	  customer from any point in time. Gotta admit, this is pretty
	  slick (#35)

2009-01-11 17:47  vmc

	* Artisan/Customer.php: Added the different revision constants
	  types (A, M, D) and the head as 'head' and added the member
	  variables for keeping track of revision data (#35)

2009-01-11 16:06  vmc

	* Artisan/Vo.php: Updated exists() to use property_exists rather
	  than isset() so that way NULL values show up as true.

2009-01-11 15:16  vmc

	* Artisan/Customer.php, Artisan/Customer/Adapter/Db.php,
	  Artisan/Db/Sql.php, Artisan/Db/Sql/Select.php, Artisan/User.php:
	  Commented out the building of the sql during the echo to prevent
	  reset queries being executed. Perhaps a flag for when queries are
	  built is set, and then when executed, unset so that way building
	  only has to happen once.

2009-01-11 05:23  vmc

	* Artisan/User/Db.php: Made protected so classes derived from here
	  can use it

2009-01-11 05:11  vmc

	* Artisan/Db/Sql/Select.php: Fixed #33 by adding the code to clear
	  the group_field_list and set the order_field and order_method to
	  NULL at the end of build()

2009-01-11 03:55  vmc

	* httpdocs/Controllers, httpdocs/index.php, httpdocs/public:
	  Renamed Controllers to public

	  update to remove the __FUNCTION__ and __CLASS__ parameters to the
	  thrown exceptions in the system for #32

2009-01-04 13:20  vmc

	* Artisan/Customer/Adapter/Db.php, Artisan/Db/Adapter/Mysqli.php:
	  Removed the __CLASS__ and __FUNCTION__ from the exception call

2009-01-04 13:20  vmc

	* Artisan/Exception.php: Removed the optional arguments from the
	  constructor with regards to the class and method names

2009-01-04 05:27  vmc

	* Artisan/Exception.php: Huge update to exception class, now no
	  longer have to pass the class and function as that is already
	  taken from the trace, this'll make throwing exceptions much
	  easier.

2009-01-04 04:57  vmc

	* Artisan/Customer/Adapter/Db.php: Added the initial parts of the
	  _load() method, updated the constructor to use the table list
	  found in the config

2009-01-04 04:56  vmc

	* Artisan/Validate/Ascii.php, Artisan/Validate/Between.php,

2008-10-26 13:33  vcherubini

	* Artisan/Controller.php: Added some comments.

2008-08-11 10:37  vcherubini

	  to be _load() and made it protected.

2008-08-02 15:46  vcherubini

	  children classes will automatically inherit it.

2008-08-02 15:38  vcherubini

	* Artisan/Config/Array.php, Artisan/Config/Xml.php: Updated both of
	  these to use the new signature of _init() and load(), removed
	  private member variable.

2008-08-02 15:37  vcherubini

	* Artisan/Config.php: Renamed internalize() to _init(), made it
	  non-static, and updated the signature to not require the
	  parameter as it was always , so it was pointless to continually
	  pass that around.

	  everything.

2008-07-02 12:15  vcherubini

	* Artisan/Library.php: Updated the way load() works, split it out
	  into a private method, _load(). load() now attempts to see if the
	  class being included is a child class (Config_Array,
	  Database_Mysqli, etc) and it's parent class (ie, Config,
	  Database, Template, etc..). If so, the parent class is loaded
	  first, and then the child class is loaded. This means one can do
	  something like Artisan_Library::load('Config/Array') and
	  automatically have Config, Config_Exception and Config_Monitor
	  loaded (the last two are loaded by Config).

2008-06-30 01:36  vcherubini

	* Artisan/Database/Mysqli.php: When throwing an error in connect(),

	  flush() method.

2008-06-01 20:50  vcherubini

	* Artisan/Database.php: Added code in constructor to detect the
	  database type and build the class based on that. This is very
	  experimental and will probably break a lot of things. More
	  updates to come.

2008-06-01 20:48  vcherubini

	* Artisan/Log/Database.php, Artisan/Log/Exception.php,

	  lazy initialization as the status of any database connection is
	  unknown.

2008-06-01 03:04  vcherubini

	* Artisan/Session.php: The default constructor now requires the
	  argument to be of type Artisan_Config, included the
	  Session/Exception class as well.

2008-06-01 03:00  vcherubini

	* Artisan/Database/Mysqli.php: Updated the constructor to force the
	  configuration passed to it to be of type Artisan_Config. Updated
	  the connect() method so that the variable uses the new object
	  method rather than the array method.

2008-05-31 12:53  vcherubini

	* Artisan/Xml.php: Finished the toXml() method that takes an
	  associative array and converts it to an XML string.

2008-05-31 12:53  vcherubini

	* Artisan/Json.php: Added simple JSON class to use PHP's
	  json_encode() and json_decode(). Because Artisan should be used
