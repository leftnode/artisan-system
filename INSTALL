== Installation ==
Installation of Artisan System PHP5 Framework 0.3beta has been made much simpler with this release. This tutorial is also included with the official release and assumes you are using Apache 2.2, MySQL 5+, PHP 5.2+, have mod_rewrite and mod_vhost_alias installed for Apache, and have root access.

First, create a vhosts directory from where Apache serves requests (assuming /var/www/ is the DocumentRoot):

cd /var/www/
mkdir vhosts

Checkout the 0.3beta release from within the /var/www/vhosts/ directory:

cd vhosts
svn co http://svn.leftnode.com/artisan_system/tags/0.3beta/ artisan.dev

This will create a directory named artisan.dev with three sub-directories (not including the .svn directory):

    * Artisan
    * httpdocs
    * Install_Sql

== Create the Database ==

Execute the trunk.001.create_database.sql file from within the Install_Sql to create the initial database:

cd artisan.dev/Install_Sql
mysql -uusername -p < trunk.001.create_database.sql

You will be prompted for your database username password. This will create a database named `artisan_system` on your computer.
Configure Database Connection

Navigate to the httpdocs directory and copy the configure.template.php file to configure.php:

cd ../httpdocs/
cp configure.template.php configure.php

Open configure.php and set the values for the database connection:

vim configure.php

Change the values in the variable $config_db. Set the database name as `artisan_system`, which you just created.

== Create the Virtual Host ==

Create a Virtual Host for Apache named artisan.dev (for the time being, this assumes you are running Ubuntu, how to set up a Virtual Host is not operating system/distro dependent, but Ubuntu makes it very easy):

<VirtualHost *>
  ServerName artisan.dev
  DocumentRoot /var/www/vhosts/artisan.dev/httpdocs/
</VirtualHost>

Save the file and exit Vim. Enable the Virtual Host and restart Apache:

sudo a2ensite artisan.dev
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

Finally, set up your hosts file so you can navigate to http://artisan.dev/ in your browser:

sudo vim /etc/hosts

Add the following to the end of the file:

127.0.0.1	artisan.dev

Restart your Internet connection. You can navigate to http://artisan.dev/ in your browser now:

sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
